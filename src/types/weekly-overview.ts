// the data layer (src/lib/weekly-overview.ts) returns and the Calendar / Status
// views render.

// The board is a per-year set of Mon–Fri columns. A lesson appears on the board
// only once a plan exists for it; the plan carries its placement — `weekday`
// (which column) and `period` (its 1-based position in that day's stack). The
// curriculum lessons for the selected (month, week) are the POOL the "+ Add
// lesson" picker draws from, not the board skeleton.
