/**
 * Service-role Supabase client. It BYPASSES Row Level Security, so it must never
 * be used to serve user-scoped data in a user request (see AGENTS.md). Its only
 * legitimate uses here are:
 *
 *   1. Curriculum WRITES — the import endpoint upserts/reconciles `curriculum_lesson`
 *      and records `curriculum_sync_run`. The brief specifies writes go through the
 *      service role (there is no write RLS policy on these tables).
 *
 *   2. Cached curriculum READS — `curriculum_lesson` is global reference data that
 *      is identical for every authenticated user. The read path is wrapped in
 *      `unstable_cache`, whose cache scope cannot access the cookie-bound auth'd
 *      client. A service-role read of non-user-scoped reference data leaks nothing
 *      a signed-in user could not already select under the `curr_read` policy.
 *
 * The `server-only` import guarantees this module can never be bundled for the
 * browser. The key is read lazily so the app still builds without it set.
