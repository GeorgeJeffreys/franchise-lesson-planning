// curriculum lessons for the selected (month · week) are the POOL the "+ Add
// lesson" picker draws from — the board groups plans by curriculum week via each
// plan's `curriculum_lesson_id`, then lays them out by weekday.
//
// Everything goes through the auth'd, cookie-bound Supabase client, so RLS scopes
// the reads: the teacher's own `class_teachers` rows, and the `lesson_plans` they
// may see (class/centre within their centre, org across centres). The service-role
