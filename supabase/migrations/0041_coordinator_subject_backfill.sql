-- 0041_coordinator_subject_backfill.sql
--
-- Role-first access model, migration 2 of 2: the data backfill + finalisation.
-- ⚠️ CORE AUTH. Requires 0040. Apply immediately after 0040 so existing
-- coordinators are represented in `coordinator_subject` when the role-first modal
-- goes live. (0040 is the coordinator_subject schema migration; note 0039 in this
-- repo is the unrelated impersonation-role-toggle migration.)
--
-- This is written DATA-DRIVEN — it operates on whatever legacy rows exist rather
-- than hardcoding ids, so it is correct for any live reconciliation counts and is
-- non-destructive to teacher data. Documented rules:
--
--   1. Backfill — every DISTINCT (profile, subject) that has a legacy
--      role='coordinator' subject_membership row becomes a coordinator_subject row.
--      A coordinator who held only SOME schools is promoted to all-schools: that IS
--      the new semantic. Widens reach only; destroys nothing.
--   2. Remove the legacy role='coordinator' subject_membership rows — they are now
--      fully represented in coordinator_subject.
--   3. Admins hold no spaces — strip every subject_membership AND coordinator_subject
--      row from admin profiles (runs AFTER the backfill, so an admin who had a legacy
--      coordinator row is cleared from both tables).
--   4. Mixed-role users (both teacher and coordinator legacy rows) — their coordinator
--      subjects migrate (rule 1); their leftover TEACHER rows are LEFT INTACT
--      (non-destructive). They derive as coordinator in the modal, and a later admin
--      save (setUserAccess) reconciles them to a single role. No teacher data is
--      destroyed here.
--   5. Non-cartesian teachers are NOT touched (accepted; cartesian expansion only
--      happens on a deliberate modal save).
--   6. Finalise — with the legacy coordinator rows gone, drop the transitional legacy
--      branch from is_coordinator_of_subject and from list_users_admin so
--      coordinator_subject is the SINGLE source of truth. (is_member_of_subject keeps
--      its subject_membership branch — that is the permanent TEACHER check, not a
--      legacy coordinator branch — and shares_subject_space never had a legacy
--      coordinator branch, so both are already final and are left untouched.)
--
-- CC never applies migrations — George runs this in the Supabase SQL editor.
-- Idempotent (ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING / idempotent deletes / CREATE OR REPLACE):
-- safe to re-run.

-- ── 1. Backfill coordinator_subject from legacy coordinator rows ──────────────
insert into public.coordinator_subject (profile_id, subject_id)
select distinct sm.profile_id, sm.subject_id
from public.subject_membership sm
where sm.role = 'coordinator'
on conflict (profile_id, subject_id) do nothing;

-- ── 2. Remove the now-migrated legacy coordinator rows ───────────────────────
delete from public.subject_membership where role = 'coordinator';

-- ── 3. Admins hold no spaces in either model ─────────────────────────────────
delete from public.subject_membership sm
using public.profiles p
where p.id = sm.profile_id and p.role = 'admin';

delete from public.coordinator_subject cs
using public.profiles p
where p.id = cs.profile_id and p.role = 'admin';

-- ── 4. Finalise is_coordinator_of_subject — coordinator_subject only ─────────
-- Legacy per-school subject_membership branch removed. Deactivation guard, signature
-- (p_school kept for caller compatibility, now unused), volatility, and search_path
-- unchanged.
