-- seed.sql
-- Seed reference data: schools, the English subject, classes, and a sample of
-- the activity_bank. Runs after migrations (supabase db reset / supabase start).
--
-- profiles and class_teachers are intentionally NOT seeded: they require real
-- auth users and are handled in the auth phase.

-- activity_bank — the full pre-approved sets for the two blocks that have menus
-- (Check for Understanding + Exit Ticket). Upserted on the (block_type, name)
-- key (migration 0007) so ids stay stable across re-seeds. Re-running this seed
-- against an already-populated DB fully replaces the old sample (the trailing
-- delete prunes any cfu/exit_ticket rows no longer in the canonical set).
